### Relative Factors
+ Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is used to describe the level of consciousness
    + E Eye Opening Response (Max 4)
    + V Verbal Response (Max 5)
    + M Motor Response (Max 6)
+ Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) is an anatomical-based coding system
    The score written as 12(34)(56).7
    + 1 - Body region
    + 2 - Type of anatomical structure
    + 3, 4 - Specific anatomical structure
    + 5, 6 - Level
    + 7 - Severity of score
+ Injury Severity Score (ISS) is used to define the term major trauma
    + 1 <= ISS <= 75
    + ISS = sum of 3 highest AIS<sup>2</sup>
    + ISS = 75 when AIS = 5 for each category
    + If any of AIS = 6, ISS is automatically set at 75
    + Major truama (or polytrauma) when ISS > 15
+ Respiratory Rate
